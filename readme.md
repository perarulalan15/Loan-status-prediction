# Loan Status Prediction

## Overview

This Python project focuses on predicting loan status using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a dataset containing relevant features, the goal is to build a robust model that can accurately predict whether a loan applicant is likely to be approved or denied.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract valuable features and transform data for model compatibility.
- **Model Selection:** Utilize various machine learning models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting for prediction.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the chosen model for practical use in loan status prediction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/perarulalan15/loan-status-prediction.git
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:

    ```bash
